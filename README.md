   PROGECT :  IMAGE FORGERY DETECTION BASED ON FUSION OF LIGHTWEIGHT USING DEEPLEARNING MODELS
   
  OBJECTIVE : This project aims to develop methods to detect fake images shared on social media. We will explore how to:
  
  1. Embed watermarks or signatures in images when they are created to verify authenticity later.
  2. Analyze image features directly to spot signs of manipulation like resizing or compression.
  3. Evaluate these methods considering how widely available editing tools and social media platforms impact their effectiveness.

 Modules Used In Project :
  Numpy
  Pandas
  Tensorflow
  Matplotlib

  STEPS :
  1.Images
  
  2.Finetuned Features
  
  3.LeightWeight Algorithms [ Shuffle Net,  squeezy Net, Mobilize Net ]
   These algorithms are extracted with the finetuned features then it gives the support vector machine 
  4. support vector machine 
  
     classification ( Forgery images , Genuine images )
     the support vector machine give's the output images are forgery or Genuine.

 CONCLUSION :
  The results highlight the strength of our method in distinguishing real images from fakes and suggest that it is a valuable tool for image forgery detection. This work not only addresses current challenges in the field but also provides a solid foundation for future research into detecting various types of image manipulations.
